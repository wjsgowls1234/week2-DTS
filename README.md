# Discrete-Time Signal Generation in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code to generate and visualize six fundamental **discrete-time signals**.  
The purpose of this project is to understand the mathematical definitions of these signals and how to represent them visually â€” a core skill for any **signal processing, data, or AI engineer**.

## ðŸ“Œ Signals Implemented

The `signals.m` script generates the following signals:

![DTS](./image/DTS_1.png)
1. **Unit Impulse Signal**  
   - A signal that is 1 at time `n = 0` and 0 everywhere else.  

2. **Unit Step Signal**  
   - A signal that is 1 for `n â‰¥ 0` and 0 for `n < 0`.  

3. **Unit Ramp Signal**  
   - A signal that is equal to `n` for `n â‰¥ 0` and 0 for `n < 0`.  

4. **Exponential Signal**  
   - A signal of the form `x[n] = a^n`.  
   - This code uses a **decaying signal** (`a = 0.5`) for clear visualization.  

5. **Signum Signal**  
   - A signal that is `1` for positive `n`, `-1` for negative `n`, and `0` at `n = 0`.

6. **Sinc Signal**  
A signal defined as:

`sinc(n) = sin(Ï€ n) / (Ï€ n)`

## ðŸ“Š Simulation Results

The script generates plots of all six signals, organized in a **3Ã—2 grid** for easy comparison.  

*(Sample plots will appear here once the script is executed.)*
